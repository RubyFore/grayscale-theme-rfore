                <p>Hello!</p> 
                <p>I am currently employed as a Post-Master's RA - Statistician at Pacific Northwest National Lab. I previously worked as an R programmer/bioinformatic analyst at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, focused on genomic data.  </p>
                <p>I hold two degrees in statistics - B.Sc. from Brown University and M.Sc. from Oregon State University. I am passionate about the power of statistics to translate gathered data into actionable knowledge through the lens of mathematics. I'm also interested in interpreting statistical results for a wide range of audiences, from middle-schoolers to career scientists. </p>
                <p>Outside of work, I enjoy cooking the freshest veggies, exercising, getting outdoors and reading. I also play the piano.</p>
